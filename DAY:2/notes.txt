1. Tag your Docker image:

First, you need to tag your Docker image with your Docker Hub username and the repository name.

bash

docker tag image_name your_dockerhub_username/repository_name:tag

Replace image_name with the name of your local Docker image, your_dockerhub_username with your Docker Hub username, repository_name with the name of the repository you want on Docker Hub, and tag with the version or tag you want to assign.


2. Log in to Docker Hub:

Use the docker login command to log in to Docker Hub in your terminal.

bash

docker login

You'll be prompted to enter your Docker Hub username and password.

3. Push the tagged image to Docker Hub:

Once logged in, push the tagged image to Docker Hub using the docker push command.

bash

docker push your_dockerhub_username/repository_name:tag

This will upload the image to your specified repository on Docker Hub.
